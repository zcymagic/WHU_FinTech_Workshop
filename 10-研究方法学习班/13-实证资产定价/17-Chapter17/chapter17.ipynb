    "# CHAPTER 17 OPTION-IMPLIED VOLATILITY\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this, the final empirical chapter of this book, we investigate the ability of variables calculated from option prices to predict future stock returns and future option returns\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17.1.1 Literature Review\n",
    "### Implied volatility variables with future stock returns\n",
    "1. The difference between the implied volatility of at-the-money (ATM) call options and ATM put options, a measure commonly referred to as the call minus put implied volatility spread, has a strong positive relation with future stock returns.(Bali and Hovakimian 2009, Cremers and Weinbaum 2010)\n",
    "2. There is a strong negative relation between future stock returns and the realized minus implied volatility spread, which is defined as the difference between volatility calculated from historical stock returns and option-implied volatility calculated from option prices.(Bali and Hovakimian 2009, Jackwerth and Rubinstein 1996, Bakshi and Kapadia 2003a 2003b, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang 2006, Carr and Wu 2009)\n",
    "3. The slope of the implied volatility smirk, which measures risk-neutral skewness, has a strong cross-sectional relation with future stock returns.(Xing et al. 2010, Rehman and Vilkov 2012, DeMiguel, Plyakha, Uppal, and Vilkov 2013, Bollen and Whaley 2004, Garleanu, Pedersen, and Poteshman 2009)\n",
    "4. The changes in call implied volatility and the changes in put implied volatility positively predict future stock returns. (An, Ang, Bali, and Cakici 2014)\n",
    "### Implied volatility variables with future option returns\n",
    "5. In addition to the growing literature that examines cross-sectional relations between option price-based variables and stock returns, there is a smaller line or research that examines the returns of options. Goyal and Saretto (2009) demonstrate that the realized minus implied volatility spread, discussed earlier, has a very strong positive cross-sectional relation with the future returns of straddles, delta-hedged calls, and delta-hedged puts.\n",
    "6. According to Goyal and Saretto (2009), high (low) implied volatilities relative to historical volatility are indications of overpriced (underpriced) options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17.1.2 OPTIONS SAMPLE\n",
    "1. The set of stocks upon which options trade is substantially smaller than full set of U.S.based common stocks that comprise the CRSP sample\n",
    "2. The source most commonly used by empirical asset pricing researchers for options data is the OM database.\n",
    "3. The data began in January of 1996 and end in January 2013.\n",
    "4. We remove entries where the closing price (close field) in the security price table is less than or equal to 0.01 dollar.\n",
    "5. Finally, for consistency with the CRSP sample used throughout most of this text, our analyses of returns will examine returns in months t+1 from February 1996 through December 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17.2 OPTION-BASED VARIABLES\n",
    "### 17.2.1 Predictive Variables\n",
    "#### Call Minus Put Implied Volatility Spread (Baliand Hovakimian 2009, Cremers and Weinbaum 2010)\n",
    "![blob](https://i.loli.net/2020/05/20/QLtZCafI6wyviA2.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Realized Minus Implied Volatility Spread\n",
    "1. We take Vol1Mi,t − IVoli,t to be one measure of the difference between realized and implied volatility.(Bali and Hovakimian 2009)\n",
    "2. We let Vol12M − IVol be the difference between the 12-month realized volatility and the ATM implied volatility. (Goyal and Saretto 2009)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implied Volatility Skew (Xing et al. 2010)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 17.2.2 Option Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Straddle Returns\n",
    "* A straddle position consists of a call and a put with the same strike and same expiration. Straddle returns are calculated assuming that the straddle is created from the same options used to determine the ATM call implied volatility (IVolC, ATM) and the ATM put implied volatility (IVolP, ATM).\n",
    "![blob](https://i.loli.net/2020/05/20/cjwdML7bp5V9UDQ.png)\n",
    "* The payoff of the straddle position is the absolute value of the difference between the spot price of the stock at expiration and the strike price of the options used to create the straddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delta-Hedged Call Returns (Delta 中性策略）\n",
    "* Delta: 期权价格变动与其标的资产价格变动的比率\n",
    "* 证券组合的Delta为零称其处于Delta中性状态。当证券组合处于Delta中性状态时，组合的价值不受标的资产价格波动的影响。但Delta中性状态只能维持很短的时间，为了保持Delta中性需要不断调整保值资产头寸，这种过程成为再平衡（rebalancing），这种保值方法成为动态套期保值。\n",
    "* 假设一个金融机构持有以下3个关于某标的股票的头寸：\n",
    "  100000份看涨期权的长头寸，每份期权的Delta为0.533\n",
    "  200000份看涨期权的短头寸，每份期权的Delta为0.468\n",
    "  整个证券组合的Delta为：\n",
    "  100000 * 0.533 - 200000 * 0.468\n",
    "\n",
    "* The payoff of the delta-hedged call position at expiration is simply the sum of the payoffs of the call position and the forward position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delta-Hedged Put Returns\n",
    "* The delta-hedged put’s payoff is the payoff of the put option (the maximum of the strike price minus the spot price at expiration, and zero) plus the payoff of the forward contract times the size of the position in the forward contract\n",
